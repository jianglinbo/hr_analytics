Series of small machine learning (ML) tasks centered on kaggle HR data set

## Purpose ##

Not quite sure how to structure this repo, but I wanted to build out an 
example of a modular ML flow that I feel is good practice for any common 
ML task.

This includes a couple of what I consider to be key steps in the process.
In particular:

* Loading + Exploration

* Pre-processing
  * Feature selection
  
* Modeling 
  * Training/Testing
  * Validation
  
* Reporting
